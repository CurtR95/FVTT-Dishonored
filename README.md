# Foundry VTT Dishonored (Unofficial)

> Dishonored Tabletop System in Foundry VTT
\
You **MUST** own the [Dishonored Tabletop RPG](https://www.modiphius.net/collections/dishonored-the-roleplaying-game) to play this! This system does not attempt to explain the game or include any ready made characters, features or items. The system is designed for those who understand the rules and want to play via Foundry VTT. Modiphius own's the property, as such I will not discuss rules and content with those who have not purchased the system from Modiphius. I am in no way affiliated with Modiphius, I only share this with their permission.

  - Don't be afraid to raise an issue with a question or support tag! However, if you don't feel comfortable, you can get hold of me on discord! Either tag @KaitoR in the  Foundry VTT discord server. Support for this system is under the modiphius-2d20 channel or send me a DM. I check Discord daily; however, I live in the UK thus work via GMT.
