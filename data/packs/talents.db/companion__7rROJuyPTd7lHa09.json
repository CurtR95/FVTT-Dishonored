The wolfhound has the profile shown on page 257, and it is treated as an allied NPC under your command, following the rules laid out in Chapter 11: Of Street Urchins & Masked Aristocrats. If your companion dies, you immediately gain a Void point, and you have a choice between retraining the talent or getting a replacement companion.</p>",
