This may be done during character creation, or later in play as part of character advancement.</p><p>You met the Outsider in a dream, and he branded you with his mark—a jagged symbol on the back of your left hand. You gain an additional personal truth, marked by the Outsider. In addition, you gain a selection of supernatural powers and enhancements which you are able to learn and use, as described in Chapter 7: Into the Void.</p>",
