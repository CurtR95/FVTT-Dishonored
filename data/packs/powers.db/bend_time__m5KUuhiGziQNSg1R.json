When you use bend time, you may take two actions instead of one, resolving them one after the other. While time is slowed, other charactersâ€™ actions are slowed, adding +2 to the difficulty of any tests they attempt as part of a contest against you. This lasts for one round, or approximately ten seconds.</p>",
