Most knives are relatively small, and easy to conceal within clothing, making them an ideal choice for assassins and other murderers seeking to avoid detection, or as a backup tool for those who don’t wish to blunt a sword on routine tasks. Folding pocket knives are common in rural parts of the Empire as tools for this kind of purpose. Cults and worshipers of the Outsider often use oddly-shaped daggers as ritual implements, with animal sacrifice and bloodletting being common parts of their rites. Wielding a knife often suggests ill intent, unless there’s a good reason to be holding one.</span> </p>",
