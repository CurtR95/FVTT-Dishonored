This can be an expensive endeavor, with few outfits worn more than a handful of times, and the fashionable styles changing with the seasons and whatever is novel and exciting at court. Appearing in such clothing can make a person appear wealthy, though they will still need to act appropriately to maintain the guise.</p><p>No less than 150 coin for a single outfit. Not less than 1000 coin for a modest wardrobe of fine clothing.</p>",
