		"description": "<p>The contemporary pistol uses a mechanism which pierces and ignites a small reservoir of whale oil at the base of each bullet, propelling the bullet forwards with explosive force, often shattering the metal cap of the bullet into a cloud of shrapnel. Pistols are loud but highly effective weapons at relatively close ranges, though the expense of manufacturing them and their ammunition means that they are reserved for the wealthy. Though fairly reliable, pistols do have a small chance of misfiring, typically destroying the pistol, and even when they work perfectly, they need to be reloaded between shots. Many inventors dabble in new pistol designs as a sideline to their main works, so custom pistols are occasionally found amongst wealthy gun aficionados, more often as a conversation piece than a practical weapon.</p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Higher quality pistols may cost more. Bullets cost 3 coin apiece.</span></p>",
