A solid blow from a cudgel is no less deadly than a sword, and while they’re awkward to use, it is still possible to batter through an enemy’s defenses, and it can still block a sword strike if the wielder is quick enough. A character who carries a cudgel of some kind is clearly ready for trouble, and often looking for it. Purpose-made cudgels are often used by prison guards and animal trainers to discipline their charges.</p>",
