The tools will all be of fine and delicate quality, for maximum precision. Most toolkits include a loupe—a magnifying eyepiece for seeing small details more closely–and slim sets of screwdrivers, tweezers, and pliers for manipulating small objects carefully.</p><p>Better toolkits may cost far more, or require custom parts which must be hand-made or commissioned separately.</p>",
