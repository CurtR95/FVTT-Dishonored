Weighted dice that tend to roll a particular number are a common example, as are playing cards which are marked in a way only their owner can detect or which allow them to shuffle or deal in a particular way. The latter are also favored by self-proclaimed fortune tellers, who can use a rigged deck of tarot cards to falsify the fortunes they tell. Regardless, itâ€™s not a good idea to be caught using the tools of a cheater.</p>",
