They contain a collection of cosmetics to color the skin, as well as prosthetics that can add or conceal details such as scars, a differently-shaped nose, and similar. Better ones contain a wider range of prosthetics and cosmetics, and may also include several wigs and dyes that can be used to change hair color. When skillfully used, a disguise kit can make a person unrecognizable, or even make them appear as someone else entirely.</p><p>Better kits may cost twice this.</p>",
