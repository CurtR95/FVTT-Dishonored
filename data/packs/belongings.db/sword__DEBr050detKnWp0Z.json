		"description": "<p>The majority of trained fighters in the Empire wield swords, whether as a primary weapon or as a sidearm. Soldiers, City Watch, and other professional fighters tend to carry sturdy, mass-produced blades of industrial steel, while officers and others wealthy enough to afford the swordsmithâ€™s craft can get blades with better balance, a keener edge, or simply a finer finish. Even street gangs and criminals use something swordlike, often making them out of repurposed cleavers or shears reinforced for fighting, or picking up military surplus. A sword is a potent tool for offense and defense, and a decent blade is good for cutting, stabbing, and parrying. A good quality sword is also a sign of status and discernment, while a particular style of sword may signify membership in an organization.</p><p>Higher quality swords may cost much more.</p>",
