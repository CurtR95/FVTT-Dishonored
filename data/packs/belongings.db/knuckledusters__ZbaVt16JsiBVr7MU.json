They’re a common street weapon, and while purpose-made versions exist, most are improvised tools, modified work gloves, handwraps with metal studs or coins folded into the cloth, or roughly-shaped metal that fits around the hand. While they make for effective weapons–when used by someone who knows how to punch– they have no real place outside of street gangs and other low-born fights.</p>",
